The Assembly 2007 computer festival was held in Helsinki on 2nd to 5th of August 2007. This year my demo group
[cubicle](http://www.cubicle.fi/) didn't have any entries for the competitions, so I didn't have to spend my summer holidays coding 12 hours a day.
However, visiting Assembly has been a part of my summers since 1994 and a lot of old friends were coming to the party, so
once again tickets were bought.

Besides meeting friends, there is always a special feeling watching the competitions on the big screen. Watching own entry is
an emotional roller coaster consisting of anxiety, addrenaline rush and calming down when you are awaiting the reactions of over
3000 people. No such rush this year, but instead a great demo competition.

had great entries well worth watching. Other competitions that were positive in their quality were the 4k and short film competitions. Especially the
winner of the short film competiton
[Realtime Demo Wannabe](http://www.scene.org/file.php?file=%2Fparties%2F2007%2Fassembly07%2Fshort_film%2Frealtime_demo_wannabe_by_maxon__fake_h264_1856kbps.mp4&fileinfo)
by Maxon was a great example of good demo design and graphical vision.

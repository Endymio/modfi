Every once in a while you found a little application that seems to do everything right and it makes you
simply wonder why nobody else did it before.

The latest case was [Launchy](http://launchy.net), a simple utility for launching applications by writing part of their name.
This doesn't sound much and you might wonder what makes it better than pressing windowkey+r for the run
dialog or launching applications through a shell.

The biggest reason is the really good adaptive prediction of what you are going to write. In my case
simply writing the "f" letter gives the suggestion to launch Firefox. This is several keystrokes faster
than using the run dialog. I'm not going to write all the features it has, because you can find about them
at the [launchy.net](http://launchy.net) site and test it yourself.

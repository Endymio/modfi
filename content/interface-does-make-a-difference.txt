Having bought my previous computer back in 2005 with a limited budget and a sempron 1.6GHz processor, upgrading from
Windows XP to Vista didn’t seem to make much sense. Furthermore, I’ve been using Vista for the last 18 months at work
and my experiences with it didn’t give me any real reasons to go through the hassle of installing a new operating system.

Two days ago I bought a new Intel i7 based computer and decided to install 64bit Windows 7 release candidate as operating
system. And so far I am extremely impressed with the modifications made in user interface and usability. If I hadn’t been
using Vista at work, the changes might have been a bit overwhelming, but with Vista experience everything simply seems easier
to use compared to Vista.

I’ve listed a few of my favorite features below. If I try to analyze why these changes are good for me, it seems that finally
allow me retire some old software that I’ve used to overcome problems with the Windows XP / Vista user interface. In addition,
they are a direct response to the fact that computers and especially screen space has increased dramatically since the launch of XP.

## Window handling
Dockable windows with easy maximize, restore and half screen sizing might finally allow me to use more than one window at
one monitor. In addition the changes make using a multi monitor system a lot easier. Still I do miss the multimon icon
that moved a window from one monitor to another in one click. In addition, the keyboard shortcuts seem logical and will
probably be used as often as alt+tab were previously.

## Peeking
I am not afraid to say, but I believe that stacking similar windows in the taskbar was simply a bad fix to the problem
of how to manage many open windows. The problem was both in the fact that finding the correct window from the stacked
ones was hard and that grouping by application doesn’t help in having the right windows available for the current task.
Peeking does solve the finding issue quite well, even if there are problems if for example you are working with similar
folders with different paths. If I had to guess, I believe that the next change in taskbar goes towards a workspace
mentality, which has gained a lot of popularity in complex applications.

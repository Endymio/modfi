As can be read in the post [Why I chose WordPress](http://endymio.cubicle.fi/article/why-i-chose-wordpress),
the previous incarnation of this site was built on top of [WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org/).
Unfortunately one thing that I didn't consider was the fact that because WordPress is extremely widely used piece of software
and it requires some attention in the form of making sure security updates have been installed sooner than later.

Therefore it didn't take that long for the site to be hacked with spam links and some of the content being destroyed. When it happened for
the first time I simply installed the latest version and didn't think much about it. After the second time this happened I
simply removed the old site until I could find time for a lasting solution.

## New site

So here we are, another custom CMS coded, designed and implemented in one weekend. Hopefully this version will serve longer than any of the previous incarnation.

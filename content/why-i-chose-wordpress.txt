To be blunt, my old home page was pretty much abandoned after I had finished the first published version of. Nothing new here -
personal web pages and blogs are easy to create, but usually slowly fade away as the initial enthusiasm is gone.

In my case, I had made a small CMS system for posting news as well as a couple of static pages (pretty much the same as in this blog).
The site was fully functional and I had even managed to finish the basic administration tools. However, there were a lots of things
left to do, so whenever I thought about my homepage the first thought was fixing these issues instead of writing new content.
Furthermore, my free time was severely limited during the last year because of work and other commitments and I never had enough
motivation to do something about it.

When I finally had some free time to do something for the project I decided to reconsider my options. I knew that I could easily
continue to extend my CMS system, but because I had built similar systems at work, I really didn’t feel too motivated about it.
Instead, I wanted to keep the project as something that would be fun and could teach me new things.

Therefore I started looking first at CMS systems. I tested both Mambo CMS and Drupal, but both of these solutions seemed too
heavy for the simple home page I had in mind. In addition, it felt like it would probably take too much time to learn them well
enough so that I could make the customizations I wanted.

Instead of a CMS, I decided to use blogging software. Because I had my own domain with and Apache, MySQL and PHP available, the
blogging software would have to work with those requirements. I did a little bit googling and found a blog system breakdown that
gave me initial pointers. Through some more googling I found out that WordPress would probably be the best choice for my
requirements. I decided to give it a go and found that the installation was a breeze. I had a new site running in less than
30 minutes - and that included reading documentation, downloading and setting a sub domain for testing.

After installing WordPress I didn’t feel like I would have to try and find a better platform. In a few days I had modified the
site to my liking and decided to abandon my old site.
